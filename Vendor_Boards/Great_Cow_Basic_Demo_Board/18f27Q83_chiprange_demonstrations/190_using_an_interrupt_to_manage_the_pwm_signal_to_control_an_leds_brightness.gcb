'''
''' This demonstration will show how you can control a motor using a PWM signal.
'''
''' Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is a scheme that provides power to a load by switching
''' quickly between fully on and fully off states. The PWM signal resembles a square wave
''' where the high portion of the signal is considered the on state and the low portion of
''' the signal is considered the off state. The high portion, also known as the pulse width,
''' can vary in time and is defined in steps. A longer, high on time will illuminate the LED
''' brighter. The frequency or period of the PWM does not change.
'''
''' This program demostrates a method where the number of steps applied,
''' which lengthens the pulse width are calculated in an Interrupt routine.
''' The PWM period defined as the duration of one complete cycle or the total
''' amount of on and off time combined is based on a simple counter.
'''
''' The demo varies the PWM to the LED.  We are pretending the motor is connected to Portb.1, via a suitable motor control device.
