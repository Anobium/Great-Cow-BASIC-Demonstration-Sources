'''A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program demonstrates shows two LCD's (16x2 & 16x4) being driven using 2 LCD I2C adapters.  Up to four I2C adapters are supported.
'''This uses the GCB software implementation of TWI/IC2 for AVR devices.
'''Two types are supported as shown below:
'''- Set LCD_I0 to 10 for the YwRobot LCD1602 IIC V1 or the Sainsmart LCD_PIC I2C adapter.
'''- Set LCD_I0 to 12 for the Ywmjkdz I2C adapter with pot bent over top of chip.
'''- Use the following to address multiple I2C devices.
'''-     #define LCD_I2C_Address 0x4e            'This is the default value, change as appropiate
'''-     #define LCD_I2C_Address_1 0x4e          'set when multiples are on the bus
'''-     #define LCD_I2C_Address_2 0x4c
'''-     #define LCD_I2C_Address_3 0x4a
'''-     #define LCD_I2C_Address_4 0x49
'''
'''-     Use the command "LCD_I2C_Address_Current = LCD_I2C_Address[_1 | _2 | _3 | _4 ] to change the LCD output routines to a specific device.
'''-     Example:
'''-                     LCD_I2C_Address_Current = LCD_I2C_Address
'''-                     Print "LCD Address is now": LCDHex(  LCD_I2C_Address_Current, 2)
'''-                     LCD_I2C_Address_Current = LCD_I2C_Address_2
'''-                     Print "LCD Address is now": LCDHex(  LCD_I2C_Address_Current, 2)
