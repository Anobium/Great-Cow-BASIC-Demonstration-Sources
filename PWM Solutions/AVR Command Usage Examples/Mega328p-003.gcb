'''A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This program will toggle the output port using the Great Cow BASIC Fixed Mode PWM method.
''' This uses two constants to fix the PWM parameters. These are 87khz @ 50% duty
''' The Fixed Mode PWM method can ONLY use PWM Channel 2
''' We have to use PWM Channel 2 on this microcontroller as PWM Channel 1 is not available as the Great Cow BASIC library requires to use PWM Channel 1 registers for computational purposes.
