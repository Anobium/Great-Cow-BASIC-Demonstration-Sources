''' Lesson 2 - "Blink"
'''
'''  One way to create a delay is to spend time decrementing a value. In assembly, the timing
'''  can be accurately programmed since the user will have direct control on how the
'''  code is executed. In 'C', the compiler takes the 'C' and compiles it into assembly before
'''  creating the file to program to the actual PIC MCU (HEX file). Because of this, it is hard
'''  to predict exactly how many instructions it takes for a line of 'C' to execute.
'''
'''  DS1 blinks at a rate of approximately 1.5 seconds.
