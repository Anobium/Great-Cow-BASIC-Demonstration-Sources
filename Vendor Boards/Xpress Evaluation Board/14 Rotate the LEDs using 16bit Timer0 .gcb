'''  Timer0 is a counter implemented in the processor. It may be used to count instruction
'''  cycles or external events, that occur at or below the instruction cycle rate.
'''  In the PIC18, Timer0 can be used as either an 8-bit or 16-bit counter, or timer. The
'''  enhanced mid-range core implements only an 8-bit counter.
'''  This lesson configures Timer0 to count instruction cycles and to set a flag when it rolls
'''  over. This frees up the processor to do meaningful work rather than wasting instruction
'''  cycles in a timing loop.
'''  Using a counter provides a convenient method of measuring time or delay loops as it
'''  allows the processor to work on other tasks rather than counting instruction cycles.
'''
'''
'''  LEDs rotate from right to left, similar to Lesson 3, at a rate of ~.5 seconds.
