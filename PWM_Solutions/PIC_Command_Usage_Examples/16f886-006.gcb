' Use program uses the Great Cow BASIC CCP/PWM.
' This enables you to change the frequency and duty dynanically.
' This example uses  CCP2/PWM set the PWM parameters and optimises subsequent PWM calls to use the fast method.
' Use HPWM_FAST to enable optimisation.
' You must only change the Duty to enable the optimisation.
'
' The first call to setup the PWM module is much slower then the second and subsequent calls.
