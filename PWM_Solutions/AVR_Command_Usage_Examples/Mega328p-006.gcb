'''A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This program will toggle the output port using the Great Cow BASIC  PWM for AVR method.
''' This program uses the Great Cow BASIC  PWM for AVR on PWM Channel 4
''' This uses a method to support the frequency and duty to be changed as the PWM parameters.
''' This shows the FOUR things you HAVE to do to enable PWM on a single channele have to use PWM Channel 2 on this microcontroller as PWM Channel 1 is not available as the Great Cow BASIC library requires to use PWM Channel 1 registers for computational purposes.
