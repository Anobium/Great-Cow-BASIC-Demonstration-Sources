'''A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This program will output a PWM signal using the Great Cow BASIC  PWM for AVR method.
''' This program uses the Great Cow BASIC  PWM for AVR on PWM Channel OC1A
'''
''' This uses a method to support the frequency and duty to be changed as the PWM parameters.
''' This shows the FOUR things you HAVE to do to enable PWM on a single channele have to use PWM OC1A on this microcontroller as PWM Channel 1 is not available as the Great Cow BASIC library requires to use PWM Channel 1 registers for computational purposes.
'''
''' Look in the program for #1, #2, #3 to setup and then #4 to use the PWM method.
