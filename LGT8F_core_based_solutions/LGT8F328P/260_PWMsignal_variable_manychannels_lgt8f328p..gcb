'''A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This program will toggle the output port using the Great Cow BASIC  PWM for AVR method.
''' This program uses the Great Cow BASIC  PWM for AVR on PWM Channel 2, 3, 4 and 7
''' This uses a method to support the frequency and duty to be changed as the PWM parameters.
''' This shows the FOUR things you HAVE to do to enable PWM on a single channele have to use PWM Channel 2 on this microcontroller as PWM Channel 1 is not available as the Great Cow BASIC library requires to use PWM Channel 1 registers for computational purposes.
